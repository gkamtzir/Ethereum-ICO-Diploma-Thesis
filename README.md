# Diploma Thesis on the Ethereum Blockchain

This is the codebase of my diploma thesis in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The thesis is focused on the process of developing a fully fledged, secure and easy to use token and ICO procedure with unique features that most other tokens do not currently have. The development starts from designing detailed flowcharts of the use cases and the overall architecture of the system to the unit tests and the actual development of the product.
