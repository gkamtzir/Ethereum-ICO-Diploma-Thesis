# Diploma Thesis on the Ethereum Blockchain

This is the codebase of my diploma thesis in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The thesis is focused on the process of developing a fully fledged, secure and easy to use token and ICO procedure with unique features that most other tokens do not currently have. The development starts from designing detailed flowcharts of the use cases and the overall architecture of the system to the unit tests and the actual development of the product.

## Project Structure

- *./diagrams/*<br />
All the supported use cases of the project as flowcharts.

- *./uml/*<br />
The uml class diagrams that describe the inner structure of the project.

- *./contracts/*<br />
The actual smart contracts (solidity code) of the project.

- *./migrations/*<br />
The migration scripts that compile and deploy the project through the [Truffle Suit](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle).
